## About

Ever wanted to start a new [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) project...

*	**without** using the terrible *Arduino IDE*?
*	**to be able to** organize your `directory tree` as you like?
*	**to be able to** put all your libraries in `libs`, your sources in `src`, your tests in `test` and your binaries in `bin`?
*	**to be able to** use `C++11` and `avr-gcc -v 4.8`?

If you answered **yes** to one of the above, this [Bare Arduino Project](https://github.com/weareleka/arduino-project) is just what you're looking for! :)

Based on what we've learned on our [Moti project](http://github.com/weareleka/moti), this repo will allow you to:

*	move away from the Arduino IDE
*	use `C++11` for your standard coding
*	use `avr-gcc 4.8` to compile your code
*	use `make` to compile, `make upload` to upload, thanks to [Sudar](https://github.com/sudar/)'s incredible project [Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile)
*	use your favorite text editor to write your code

To put it in a nuttshell, it allows you to **write Arduino code, as you would write anything else !**

## How to...

### How to install

The full procedure is detailed in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md):

*	[Quick OS X installation](https://github.com/WeAreLeka/Arduino-Project/blob/master/INSTALL.md#os-x---1092)
*	[Quick Linux installation](https://github.com/WeAreLeka/Arduino-Project/blob/master/INSTALL.md#ubuntu)
*	[Full OS X installation](https://github.com/WeAreLeka/Arduino-Project/blob/master/INSTALL.md#full-installation-guide-for-os-x-1092)

It has been written for beginners as well as for advanced hackers.

### How to use

The full procedure on how to use everything you've just installed is described in [USE.md](./USE.md).
